    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>I am a new web developer. I graduated from Southern New Hampshire University with a BS in Video Game Programming and Development</p>
    <p>I have had a passion for all things technology and video games since I was a young kid and decided that I wanted to pursue a career in the tech field. Currently working in IT as a Support Specialist and it has been a blast since everyday provides a learning opportunity and <br>
        there can always be an issue that requires a different solution than the last. I've recently started diving more into web development by learning more HTML/CSS and JavaScript because I've always enjoyed the idea of designing and creating someting
        that brings<br> creativity, excitement, and enjoyment to others!
